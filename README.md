This is a very small demo designed to illustrate core skills, given a set time constraint. This tiny demo allows a user to edit text of a predefined text element and save changes to a persistent DB.

## Quick Start
1. Select one of the items from the "Select an item" list
2. The title text should appear in the "Staging Area"
3. Edit selected item in the "Edit a title" section
4. Once finished, click "Save Changes" to save
5. Refresh to see persisted data
